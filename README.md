One of the conclusions that we can draw from the data is that more than half of the campaigns were successful

Another conclusion was that the summer months (June and July) had a slightly higher chance for being successful

The last conclusion were can observe is most of the successful campaigns were in the category of theatre/plays   

One of the limitations of this data set is that we can't see why the campaigns were successful or not

Another limitation is not being able to see if there was any advertisment for the campaign. Also how much they spent on advertsiment for each campaign.

Another limitation is not being see the incentive tier list. For example, for every $5 someone donates the get a ticket to the play and every $10 they get to bring 2 people with them.

I think adding how much money each campaign spent on advertsiment would be good to see. It would help by seeing if spending a lot of money on advertisment helps the campaign be successful

For the data set I think that the median summarizes the data because the number for the median is a lot easier to reach for the campaign than the Mean.
